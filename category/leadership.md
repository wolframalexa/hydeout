## LeafLabs
* **September 2023 - present**
	* I work on lots of hardware, mainly increasing quality and quantity of neuroscience data available to researchers, and various client projects along the way!

## Formlabs
* **August 2022 - August 2023**
	* I was an electrical engineer in R&D, working on the next generation of SLA printing (Form 4). I designed the LCD driver board, did power measurements for the system, qualified ICs and motors for mass production, worked on compliance testing and motor tuning, wrote a little firmware, and other odds and ends on the electrical side.
	* I learned lots about designing electronics & systems for mass production, designing for a wide range of customer needs, and working with a varied team of optical, mechanical, firmware, and electrical engineers.

## NVIDIA
* **Summers 2020 & 2021: Hardware Intern**
	* As a hardware intern on the Jetson team, I designed an open-source PCB that will enable makers to design their own hardware for the Jetson Nano.
	* I gained practical experience with engineering workflow and HW/SW compatibility, circuit and PCB design, and project and product management.

## Society of Women Engineers

### The Cooper Union
* **FY21: President**
	* In this role, my goal was to advocate for women and underrepresented genders in engineering at Cooper Union and beyond. I built initiatives with institutional support to recruit more women and perform outreach in the local community, including creating a mentorship program with female high school students, and connecting with admitted women students.
	* I also strengthened the relationship with the Society at large and create opportunities for our members to engage with engineering professionals.
	* SWE - Cooper Union is resilient in adapting to a changing post-coronavirus world and supporting our members through it, with online and now safe in-person events.

* **FY20: Treasurer**
	* I was responsible for managing our section's finances and interfacing with the Joint Activities Committee to get reimbursements.
	* I planned our annual Let's Talk event to bring together students, faculty, and admin to discuss issues of gender in the engineering school.

### Society-Level
* **FY21: LGBTQ and Allies Affinity Group Co-Lead**
	* In this role I support diversity and inclusion initiatives at the Society level and create opportunities for AG members. 

* **FY20: SWE Future Leader**
	* Selected as one of 20 members who have the potential to lead SWE in upcoming years.
	* Received leadership training and introductions to Society leadership.

* **WELocal 2021 Rising Star Award**
	* Recognized as one of 15 excellent collegiate leaders in the Society.

* **Recipient of SWE Scholarship**
	* Received scholarship from Society for exceptional potential as an engineer

## oSTEM
## The Cooper Union
* **FY20 and FY21: President and Founder**
	* There were no active LGBTQ-focused organizations at Cooper Union, so I founded a chapter of oSTEM. We support LGBTQ engineering students in their studies by broadening their professional network.
