<h2>Solar Car Charging Station Design (May 2020)</h2>

Designed for Electronics I, my group designed a solar and wind powered [charging station](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mlf_9_3XAzLQX73I0ryQMwHd4NbsKdRzXt7klF3OhMo/edit?usp=sharing) for an electric car and modeled it in LTSpice.

<h2>Temporary COVID-19 Ventilator (March 2020)</h2>
Working with a team from Columbia University, we designed a [makeshift ventilator](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HfpuJJX7hhtkSMgyB17YvybOcqpso5rSmR06rWZg86w/edit?usp=sharing) for COVID-19 patients in the event of a serious ventilator shortage. I designed electronics and wrote the controls code.

<h2> Pitch Theremin: Sophomore Projects (December 2019) </h2>

As part of ECE291 at The Cooper Union, my group built a [pitch theremin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SeXoJaNbIeLjNpwCGp_wtSrwWCHZ9YC8OHh2F3PvuhA/edit?usp=sharing), an ethereal instrument that is played without being touched, using oscillators, envelope detection, a low-pass filter, and a speaker. I implemented the changes from the provided schematic (notably, implementing voltage followers to prevent loading effects from the capacitive coupling).

<h2>The Dinosaur Game: Digital Logic Design Final Project (May 2019)</h2>

My partner Hadassah Yanofsky and I built [a version of Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7AopN-quus8UlS3rx4m_0wKX9mxa_iP11Y8uOVm4rU/edit?usp=sharing) using only 40XX series CMOS chips. I was responsible for the random obstacle generation and the display.

Other projects for Digital Logic Design include the [Traffic Light](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mU8ysq5N06wHEdOlbwmxjcJd6YPX3huf1eCUNwub21E/edit?usp=sharing) and [Braille](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4otYoUxSXOOWUxVkir43FO-LzfDG4o3zMiSYjK4KY/edit?usp=sharing) individual projects.

<h2>Cooper Union Motorsports</h2>

[Cooper Union's FSAE team](http://fsae.cooper.edu) is a group of student motorsports enthusiasts who design, build, test, and race a Formula One-style racecar in Brooklyn, Michigan every year. The competition includes both dynamic races and static design evaluations as well as cost and business presentations in which teams must present the market-readiness of their car. In my time on the team, I was a member of the chassis system.

As a member of the aerodynamics subsystem, I laid the groundwork for future teams to implement a Drag Reduction System (documentation link to follow), projected to decrease drag by 50%, which will greatly ameliorate the team's times particularly in the acceleration and skidpad events.

My additional responsibilities included performing carbon fiber layups end-to-end, building a PVC frame for driver fitting, preparing the business presentation, and managing two sponsorship accounts worth over $2,000.

<h2>Refugee in Flight Shelter Kit (September-December 2018)</h2>
Refugees are fleeing Sub-Saharan Africa because of political violence, climate change, and economic hardship. When people make the trek across the Sahara, they must stop to recuperate. Current UN refugee camps are underfunded, and the shelters are difficult to erect, stationary, and unsustainable since they are made of plastics. [RiFSK](http://rifsk.org), the Refugee in Flight Shelter Kit, aims to create a biodegradable, portable, waterproof, easily-buildable shelter made of locally-sourced materials to accomodate a woman and two children.

I worked on the [distribution and manufacturing group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nLI4qcUVZ-68dS0TsVXtv8S5MznLuZRTQDaR6OBwhnM/edit?usp=sharing). Refugees are always on the move and political situations are often unstable, so we designed a mobile manufacturing process that can adapt to the conditions in the region and deliver the kits to where they're needed most. I was also selected to deliver the [final presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WWTOWlHdal7Qbpx91u0PdlKRPthh0lSZ/view?usp=sharing).

<h2>What Does New York City Mean to You? Cooper Union Summer STEM 
Program (June-August 2017) </h2>

I built a Rube Goldberg machine along with 19 other high school students. I learned how to machine and new approaches to design. This is the program that made me choose a career in engineering, and to pursue my education at Cooper.

<h2>Plant-Powered Solar Cell (September 2016-March 2017)</h2>

As part of the _Travail Personnel Encadr√©_ (TPE, translated: Directed Personal Projects) required of 11th graders in the French education system, two partners and I built a photosynthetic solar cell based off of the [Graetzel Cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sensitized_solar_cell). In order to communicate our results, we wrote a lab report, produced a podcast episode, and wrote and edited a magazing about contemporary issues in solar power, all in French and all of which we defended to science teachers from other French schools in the Northeast. 

This project is meaningful to me because it's the first research project I embarked on. We failed a **lot**, and learned a **lot**. I'm almost not even embarrassed that I thought voltage and current were the same thing. Almost.
