We all have data out there. You probably have a Facebook, Twitter, email account, in addition to publicly available records on the Internet. Lately, I’ve been thinking about the information I put out into the world, by giving my consent to different websites and internet companies. In return for providing me a way to share pictures of my lunch on Instagram and communicate with colleagues via email, We may click “accept terms and conditions” without actually reading them, but this doesn’t mean our data is actually secure – it’s no secret that companies like Facebook and Google collect the data you provide them. Ostensibly, this data is used to better the user experience, but users should also have the option to not provide certain types of data, like turning off location services (although that isn’t always respected, link).
I know it’s easy to disregard your privacy, saying “I have nothing to hide,” but the reality is that many tech companies monetize the information you provide them, turning you into a product. For me, safeguarding my privacy means being able to enjoy a full life without worrying that my texts or browsing habits will be sold. I can enjoy things without that weird moment where you get an Instagram ad for something you said aloud yesterday.
Email in particular is full of personal information. Think of all the things you put through your email – forgot password links, advertising emails from websites you shop from, personal communications. Gmail, the most widespread email provider, also gives you access to a calendar, YouTube, filesharing and hosting, among others, and when logged in on Chrome, Google can link your browsing history to your account as well. Suffice it to say – Google may know you better than you know yourself.
A cool resource I was referred to when thinking about alternatives to these products is privacytools.io(link). Fair warning - this may be enough to turn you into a privacy evangelist and have your friends and family gifting you tinfoil hats – you have been warned.
It can certainly be a hassle to switch your primary email account. I had to update my email address for countless accounts, all with new passwords from a password manager (more on that in a future post?), and forward my old email. Sometimes I still forget what email I signed up for something with. However, the sheer amount of data you put through your email provider means that you want to be able to trust whoever’s administering it.
In this post, I want to take a look at a few of the most common privacy-focused email providers. I explore what encryption protocol they use, whether they’re open-source, cost, features, and something I’ll call “level of intensity”. Although it’s cool for an email provider to be open source, any one of the sites on this list are going to require you to trust them to some degree. Otherwise, you might as well not use email at all. Level of intensity is a very subjective criteria, but my aim is to measure how much of a hassle it is to use any platform (i.e. could you convert your friends? Your geeky roommate? Your grandma?). The reality is that not everyone needs a super secure email client you can only access over Tor – you might just want to limit tracking and data leaks, and that’s good enough for you. I’m definitely a huge n00b in the world of online privacy, so please feel free to suggest or point out something I missed (contact link).
