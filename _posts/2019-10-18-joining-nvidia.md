Some exciting personal news: I've accepted an offer at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a Hardware Intern for summer 2020!

The team I'll be working on does consumer electronics and embedded systems, and I'll be verifying and testing their prototypes as they come back from the fabrication facility (breaking things to fix them, as it were).

Nvidia is a partner of [Rewriting the Code](https://rewritingthecode.org/), an organization with which I am a fellow. I participated in the NYC hub this past summer, and it allowed me to connect with lots of awesome women in tech. I can't wait to do it again in the Silicon Valley hub this summer.

My Nvidia interviewers asked me some of the most challenging technical questions I had this recruiting season, and I know I'm going to learn a lot! I'm really excited to explore my interest in hardware in a cross-functional, multidisciplinary team (with lots of Cooper grads!), and spend the summer in the Bay Area (if you're around, come say hi!).
