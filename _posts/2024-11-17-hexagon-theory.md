# Concept
Recently, I've been exploring [zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) as a medium to develop and synthesize ideas. Although this zine isn't strictly technical, I've been inspired by peers to learn in public and simply make things to explore ideas - and as such, it belongs on this blog![^1]

This zine is about interpreting space through biking. I'm generally interested in local knowledge - how it's created, how it develops, how it's spread. I'm often told I know the Boston area very well despite only having lived here a short time.

I think part of that is my practice of biking everywhere. You have to know how to read drivers' behaviour, which bike racks are in front of well-trafficed locations (and therefore safe to park at), and how the streets connect to one another. You learn the major patterns of traffic flow within the city, and wave hello to friends you pass along the way. I think everyone should bike! It's great!

This zine is also about learning from and relating to others. I am greatly indebted to all my friends who've taught me their little bits of local knowledge.

If you're interested in a physical copy of the zine, you can check it out of Somerville Public Library's zine collection, or get in touch and I can mail you a copy.
