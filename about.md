Hey there! My name is Alexa.

![Alexa, a blonde white woman in a purple winter coat, stands in front of a beach](/assets/images/alexaatrockaway.jpg)

I study electrical engineering at the Cooper Union (graduating May 2022).

After graduation, I will be joining Formlabs as an electrical engineer. I previously interned on NVIDIA's consumer products team in 2020 and 2021 as a hardware intern. I do research with Dr Mili Shah at the Cooper Union in [MiliLab](http://faculty.cooper.edu/mili/miliLab/index.html) in hardware and computer vision.

My professional interests include hardware engineering, circuits, engineering ethics and policy, and climate.

In my free time, I am a polyglot (je parle français y hablo español), an avid reader, a lapsed violinist, a bread baker, and a swimmer.
