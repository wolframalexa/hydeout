Hi! My name is Alexa. I recently graduated from the Cooper Union with a degree in electrical engineering and minors in computer science and philosophy, history, and society. In August, I'll be moving to Boston to work at Formlabs, a 3D printing startup, on their electrical engineering team. 

I previously interned on NVIDIA's consumer products team in 2020 and 2021 as a hardware intern. In my time in undergrad, I did research Dr Mili Shah at the Cooper Union in [MiliLab](http://faculty.cooper.edu/mili/miliLab/index.html) in hardware and computer vision, for which I won a Goldwater scholarship, and at New York University with Dr Javad Shabani in quantum computing hardware.

My professional interests include hardware engineering, circuit and system design, engineering ethics and policy, and climate. In my free time, I am a polyglot, an avid reader, a lapsed violinist, a bread baker, and a cyclist.

Contact me by email [here](mailto:alexajakob@tutanota.com), and view my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5j3sZ5Abm2q9HjkQ7WAPXKQ4y1o-Co-/view?usp=sharing).

My theme is a Jekyll theme called <a href="https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout">Hydeout</a> by Andrew Fong.
