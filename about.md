Hey there! My name is Alexa, I'm a sophomore at Cooper Union studying electrical engineering. My interests include hardware engineering, building and debugging circuits, automating boring stuff with MATLAB and Python, classical music, podcasts, swimming, board games, math, and combinations and permutations thereof.
